# Labforward Code Challenge

## Approach:

- Two main challenges to render the sample data simulating request:
  - Parse the .xlsx file to a JavaScript/React readable file -> converted to .csv to .JSON
  - Find a React Graph Chart Library that serves the purpose (I picked React VIS - easy to use and very well documented)

-> More detailed step by step can be seen in the commits, reach out for any questions!

## Timing:

- Got the task on Friday 13th, spent some weekend time researching for libraries and best parsing method
- Started coding on Monday 15th parallel to working on other projects, finished Tuesday 16
- Total coding time: around 9h across several days
